# MathVisuals #
This repo contains scripts to visualize math concepts I have found interesting or confusing. All of the animations are made using the latest version of Manim CE

circ_to_line.py is a small visual I made to learn the basics of manim. It plays a simple video of a line mapping points on a circle to points on a number line

projective.py is a script I made to better understand real projective spaces. Right now, it contains one scene, which defines $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ and shows how $\mathbb{RP}^{1}$ is topologically equivalent to $S^{1}$. In future, I will try to add a similar scene for $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$.
